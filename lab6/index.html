	<h2> Subject</h2>
	<p> The subject of lab 6 is to make a form and add a CSS file to our lab and cst251/index.html</p>

	<h3> Challenges</h3>
	<p> The biggest challenge while working on the lab was to add the form.
		It was very interesting to learn the basics of forms but a little complicated for me because I'm not familar with the tags.  </p>

	<h4> Results</h4>
	<p> The results of the lab were surprising to me. I was able to add the form and got to see how the css
	changes the document.</p>
