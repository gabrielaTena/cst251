      <h2> Challenges</h2>
        <p> While workign on this lab I had a lot of trouble understanding
          the assigment. I didn't know how to link my other html files but in
          the end I was able to link them. The floating and flexbox situation
          were complicated although I searched in W3 schools.</p>
