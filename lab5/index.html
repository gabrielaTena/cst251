	<h1> Lab 5: More HTML</h1>
	<h2> Subject</h2>
	<p> The Subject of the Lab is to create a webpage with images and add links to other pages.</p>

	<h3> Challenges</h3>
	<p> While working on the lab, I had some difficulties but continued to keep trying.
	When trying to link the images I made some mistakes like not addding the image to the correct
	img forder. The part that I found the most interesting was to link the web page with the image
	because it makes it interactive.</p>

	<h4> Results</h4>
