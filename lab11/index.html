		<h2> Fun Facts</h2>
		<p> I was born and raised in Michoacan Mexico; in a very small town.
			I've been living in the U.S. for 5 years which means I had to learn English.</p>
		<p> I know how to make/cook corn tortillas as well as other Mexican dishes.</p>
		<p> I was a One Direction fan in my teenage years and their music helped in
			the long term my English pronunciation.<p>

		<p> The subject of the lab is to experience block level styling by adding a sidebar
		and a "nav= id" with links.</p>

		<h2> Challenges</h2>
		<p> A challenge I had was trying to make the sidebar appear in the center of the page.
		I decided to leave it on the left. I also didn't know how to get the CSS code
		to link it.</p>
