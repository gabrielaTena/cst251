		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p> While working on this lab, I encounter a couple of difficulties.<br>
			One of them was to make the images appear on the browser,<br>
			but after looking at the lectures and looking on Youtube, I still wasn't able to figure it out.</br>
			Here is the file Structure I made:</p>
			<img src="img/files.png" alt="File Structure">
			<img src="img/file-structure.png" alt="File Structure in Atom">
			<img src="img/introduction.png" alt="Introduction">
