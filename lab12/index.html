			<h2> Subject</h2>
			<p> The goal for this lab was to experiment with block level styling.
			 Some of the things we had to use were ovwrflow, float, and centering
		   things horizontally and vertically.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="challenge">
			<h2> Challenge</h2>
			<p> While working on this lab I had some difficulties but was able to
			solve most of them. When trying to style the "center-horiz, floated, center-img,
			and center-both" I forgot to add the class and spend some time figuring out why
			I couldn't see the border. Another problem I had was center-both the image.
		 	I changed the width to 150 and used the "50% top and 50% left" but the Image
			didn't centeres as I how I wanted, so I dec√üided to leave it at 15% so it looked
			visually horiz/vert centered.</h2>
