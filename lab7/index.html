		<h3> Challenges</h3>
		<p> While working on the lab, I encounter some challenges. I didn't know
		how to include the "div" as well as the purpose it had. Another issue I
		had was to create the css sheet. I decided to use the css file from last lab
		as a template and change some things like font and color backgound.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="content">
		<h4> Results</h4>
		<p>Thanks to my partner I was able to add the "div" and link the CSS file.</p>
